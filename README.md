# Welcome to Myshelf
Final Project for the CS50 Course for Harvard University.

The web application Myshelf is a virtual bookshelf which allows you to keep track of the books you owned,
the books you borrowed and the books you have given to your friends (in order to do so, your friends also need 
to register to Myshelf).
This is basically your own personal library system !
